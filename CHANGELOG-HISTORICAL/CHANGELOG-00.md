## Session 1 - Initial Implementation (2025-07-19)

### Project Setup
- Created Go project structure with `cosmos_on_near` package
- Initialized go.mod with near-sdk-go v0.0.13 dependency
- Set up TinyGo-compatible build environment

### Storage Layer
- Implemented `Store` interface abstracting NEAR storage operations
- Created `ModuleStore` wrapper with automatic key prefixing (`module|key`)
- Added block height management for simulated consensus
- Included mock store for isolated testing

### Token Module (formerly Bank Module)
- Defined `Balance` struct with Borsh serialization
- Implemented `Transfer(receiver, amount)` and `Mint(receiver, amount)` methods
- Added balance retrieval functionality
- Integrated NEAR logging for all operations

### Staking Module
- Created `Validator`, `Delegation`, and `UnbondingEntry` data structures
- Implemented delegation and undelegation with 100-block unbonding period
- Added validator management (add/activate validators)
- Built unbonding queue with automatic release processing
- Integrated 5% flat reward distribution via token minting
- Added BeginBlock/EndBlock hooks for block-level processing

### Governance Module
- Designed proposal system with voting mechanism
- Implemented parameter store for on-chain configuration
- Added 50-block voting periods with 50% quorum threshold
- Built automatic parameter application for passed proposals
- Integrated EndBlock processing for proposal tallying

### Contract Integration
- Created main contract entry point with all module integration
- Registered public functions for all module operations
- Implemented `ProcessBlock()` for cron.cat integration

### Build & Documentation
- Created TinyGo build script (`build.sh`) with error checking
- Wrote comprehensive README with deployment instructions
- Updated CLAUDE.md with development guidelines
- Added commit guidelines and TinyGo limitations documentation
- Included integration test examples

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. **Module Pattern**: Each Cosmos module as a separate Go type with its own store
2. **Storage Prefixing**: Automatic namespacing prevents cross-module conflicts
3. **Block Processing**: Manual increment simulates Tendermint consensus
4. **TinyGo Compatibility**: Careful selection of supported Go features

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual module functions
- Mock store for isolated module testing
- Integration tests for cross-module interactions
- Examples of NEAR CLI testing commands

### Production Readiness
The implementation follows Cosmos SDK patterns while adapting to:
- NEAR's execution model (no ABCI)
- TinyGo's WASM limitations
- Key-value storage instead of IAVL trees
- Direct function calls vs. message passing

### Deployment Information
- Contract size: ~420KB (optimized)
- Target runtime: NEAR Protocol
- Build tool: TinyGo 0.32.0
- WASM format: wasm32-unknown-unknown

### Example Operations
```bash
# Transfer tokens
near call $CONTRACT transfer '{"receiver":"alice.near","amount":"1000"}' --accountId bob.near

# Create proposal
near call $CONTRACT submit_proposal '{"changes":[["min_stake","5000"]]}' --accountId alice.near

# Process blocks
near call $CONTRACT process_block '{}' --accountId cron.near
```

This foundational work provides a solid base for implementing more complex Cosmos SDK features on NEAR Protocol.

```

### Module Implementations
1. **Bank Module (`bank.rs`)**
   - Converted Balance struct to use near_sdk collections
   - Implemented transfer and mint with proper NEAR promises
   - Added balance validation and overflow protection

2. **Staking Module (`staking.rs`)**

## Session 5 - WASM Deployment Issue Resolution (2025-07-20)

### Critical Discovery
- Identified that cargo was building for wrong WASM target
- near-sdk requires `wasm32-unknown-unknown` specifically
- Default cargo build was not producing NEAR-compatible WASM

### Resolution Steps
1. **Explicit Target Specification**
   ```bash
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   ```

2. **Rust Toolchain Configuration**
   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

3. **Build Output Location**
   - Correct: `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cosmos_sdk_near.wasm`
   - Wrong: `target/release/cosmos_sdk_near.wasm`

### Successful Deployment
- Contract deployed to `cuteharbor3573.testnet`
- Transaction: `12RKM38nmfz5ZaW59rS2d4a1BvdbeonMkiZj6UUknP5G`
- All functions accessible and working correctly

### Updated Documentation
- Added explicit WASM target instructions to README
- Created troubleshooting section for common issues
- Documented the complete build-deploy cycle
- Added verification steps for deployment

### Lessons Learned
1. Always specify target architecture for WASM builds
2. Verify WASM file exists before deployment attempts
3. Check rustup targets match project requirements
4. Use near-cli-rs for more detailed error messages

### Validation Results
- ✅ Contract successfully deployed
- ✅ All module functions callable
- ✅ State persistence working
- ✅ Cross-module interactions functional

This session resolved the deployment blocker and established proper build procedures for NEAR smart contracts.

## Session 9 - Cosmos SDK Module Restructuring (2025-07-21)

### Major Refactoring
Restructured the entire codebase to properly mirror Cosmos SDK module organization:

1. **Module Separation**
   ```
   src/modules/
   ├── bank/
   │   └── mod.rs         # Token operations
   ├── staking/
   │   └── mod.rs         # Validator and delegation logic
   ├── gov/
   │   └── mod.rs         # Governance functionality
   └── ibc/
       ├── client/        # Light clients
       ├── connection/    # Connection handshakes
       └── channel/       # Channel management
   ```

2. **Clean Interfaces**
   - Each module has its own storage namespace
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Proper encapsulation of module logic

3. **State Management**

   - **Cosmos Chain** (`chains/cosmos.rs`): Full Tendermint RPC integration for any Cosmos SDK chain
   - **Unified Interface**: Common `Chain` trait for both implementations

3. **Key Components**
