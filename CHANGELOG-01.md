## Session Latest - IBC Infrastructure Deployment & Handshake Automation (2025-07-30)

### IBC Testnet Infrastructure Established ✅

**Successfully Created Complete IBC Foundation:**
- **IBC Client**: Created `07-tendermint-0` Tendermint light client for Cosmos provider chain
- **IBC Connection**: Established `connection-0` in INIT state with proper counterparty configuration  
- **IBC Channel**: Created `channel-0` transfer channel for ICS-20 token transfers (port: transfer, version: ics20-1)

**Contract Deployment:**
- **Live Contract**: `cosmos-sdk-demo.testnet` with full IBC module stack operational
- **Account**: Using `cuteharbor3573.testnet` for contract operations
- **Network**: NEAR testnet with real blockchain integration

**Infrastructure Scripts Created:**
- `scripts/create_simple_ibc_client.sh` - Automated IBC client creation with correct JSON formatting
- `scripts/create_ibc_connection.sh` - Connection initialization with proper parameter structure
- `scripts/create_ibc_channel.sh` - Channel creation for token transfer applications

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- Fixed JSON deserialization issues by correcting field names (`part_set_header` vs `parts`)
- Resolved public key format issues (enum variants `Ed25519`/`Secp256k1` vs string types)
- Established proper IBC handshake initialization on NEAR side
- Verified all infrastructure components through contract view calls

### Handshake Automation Framework Fixed ✅

**Problem Resolved:**
- **Issue**: `dyn std::error::Error` cannot be sent/shared between threads safely
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent error trait bounds between NEAR and Cosmos chain constructors
- **Files Affected**: `tests/handshake_automation_tests.rs` and `src/bin/test_handshake_automation.rs`

**Solution Implemented:**
- Updated helper functions to return consistent error types with `Send + Sync` bounds
- Fixed error conversion for NEAR chain using proper trait bound mapping
- Updated all test functions to handle error-returning helper functions
- Fixed binary file with same error handling pattern

**Test Results:**
```

### Environment & Configuration

**Environment-based Key Management:**

- Real testnet key integration for both NEAR and Cosmos chains
- Production-ready relayer configuration

**Deployment Scripts:**
- Comprehensive script validation tests
- JSON format verification for IBC operations
- Safety checks and error handling

### Packet Relay Logic Implementation Completed ✅

**Complete Packet Relay System Implemented:**
- **Packet Scanner** (`scanner.rs`): Comprehensive packet detection system for both NEAR and Cosmos chains
  - Monitors IBC events: `send_packet`, `acknowledge_packet`, `timeout_packet`
  - Configurable scanning intervals and channel filtering
  - Memory management with processed packet cleanup
  - Thread-safe operation with graceful shutdown

- **Packet Processor** (`processor.rs`): Enhanced proof generation and transaction handling
  - Complete proof structures: `PacketProof`, `AckProof`, `TimeoutProof`
  - NEAR→Cosmos specialized processing with real state proofs
  - Client state and consensus state management
  - Transaction building and submission with enhanced Cosmos integration

- **Packet Relay Coordinator** (`coordinator.rs`): Orchestration and monitoring
  - Coordinates scanner, engine, and event dispatcher
  - Health monitoring and statistics collection
  - Force relay capability for testing and debugging
  - Graceful shutdown handling with proper cleanup

**Comprehensive Integration Tests:**
- **13 test cases** covering complete packet relay functionality
- Event flow validation and proof structure testing
- Error handling and resilience verification
- Complete packet lifecycle simulation (Detection → Relay → Acknowledgment)
- **All tests passing** with 0 failures

**Test Results:**
```
