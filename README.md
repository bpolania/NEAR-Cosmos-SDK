- **Deployment Target**: Ready for deployment with new unified structure

## NEAR Gas Considerations

- Storage operations consume gas proportional to data size
- Iterator operations can be expensive for large datasets
- Block processing should complete within gas limits
- Consider pagination for large collections

## Development Notes

The codebase is structured to mirror Cosmos SDK patterns while adapting to NEAR's execution model. Key differences:

1. **ABCI-Compatible Responses**: ABCI-compatible transaction responses without full ABCI message protocol
2. **Single Contract**: All modules in one contract vs. separate modules
3. **NEAR Storage**: Key-value store instead of IAVL trees
4. **Block Simulation**: Manual block increment vs. Tendermint consensus

## Local Testnet Setup

### wasmd Cosmos Testnet on Docker

The project includes a complete Docker-based wasmd testnet for local development and testing:

#### Docker Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the docker directory
cd crates/ibc-relayer/docker

# Start the wasmd testnet
docker-compose up -d

# Verify the testnet is running
docker-compose ps
```

#### Testnet Configuration
- **Chain ID**: `wasmd-testnet`
- **RPC Endpoint**: `http://localhost:26657`
- **REST API**: `http://localhost:1317`
- **gRPC**: `localhost:9090`

The testnet comes pre-configured with:
- Validator nodes with proper key management
- IBC relayer connectivity
- Test accounts with sufficient balances
- Automated initialization scripts

#### Process to Safely Stop and Restart Cosmos Testnet

**Stopping the testnet:**
```bash
# Stop all containers gracefully
docker-compose down

# Stop with volume cleanup (removes all data)
docker-compose down -v
```

**Restarting the testnet:**
```bash
# Start the testnet (will reinitialize if volumes were removed)
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs to ensure proper startup
docker-compose logs -f wasmd

# Verify chain is producing blocks
curl http://localhost:26657/status
```

**Safe restart procedure:**
1. Stop packet relaying: `cargo run -- stop`
2. Stop testnet: `docker-compose down`
3. Start testnet: `docker-compose up -d`
4. Wait for block production: Check `curl http://localhost:26657/status`
5. Restart relayer: `cargo run -- start`

For more detailed information, see the docker README and project changelog.

The foundation for NEAR-Cosmos IBC communication is successfully established and operational!

## CosmWasm Off-Chain Execution Architecture

### Problem Solved: WASM-in-WASM Limitation
NEAR contracts run in WebAssembly and cannot execute nested WASM modules like Wasmer. Our solution implements an **off-chain execution architecture** where a relayer service executes CosmWasm contracts and submits results back to NEAR for consensus.

### Current Implementation Status

#### **Completed Components**
1. **Execution Queue System**: NEAR contract queues CosmWasm execution requests instead of immediate execution
2. **Off-Chain Relayer Service**: Monitors NEAR for requests, executes via Wasmer, submits signed results
3. **Transaction Signing**: Full NEAR transaction signing with secure key management
4. **State Synchronization**: Bidirectional state management between relayer and NEAR
5. **Test Coverage**: 28+ tests passing including execution queue and relayer integration tests

#### **What You Can Do Now**
```bash
# Deploy CosmWasm contracts (e.g., CW20 tokens)
near call wasm-module.test.near store_code '{"wasm": "<base64>"}' --accountId user.near

# Execute contracts (queued for relayer)
near call wasm-module.test.near execute '{"contract": "cw20.near", "msg": "{\"transfer\":{...}}"}' --accountId user.near

# Relayer processes automatically
./relayer start-cosmwasm --config config/cosmwasm.toml
```

### Architecture Overview
```
User → NEAR Contract → Execution Queue → Relayer → Wasmer Execution → Signed Result → NEAR
```

- **On-Chain**: Contract bytecode storage, execution queue, state persistence, result application
- **Off-Chain**: Wasmer execution, result generation, transaction signing
- **Security**: Multiple relayer consensus possible, slashing conditions can be added

## Future Roadmap & Enhancements

### **Security & Decentralization**
- **Multi-Relayer Consensus**: M-of-N agreement on execution results
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Trustless execution verification
- **Optimistic Rollups**: Challenge period with fraud proofs
- **Slashing Mechanisms**: Penalize incorrect execution submissions

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Batch Processing**: Execute multiple requests in single operation
- **Parallel Execution**: Process independent contracts simultaneously
- **State Compression**: Merkle tree commitments and IPFS integration
- **Execution Caching**: Reuse common execution patterns

### **Cross-Chain Features**
- **NEAR ↔ Cosmos Bridge**: Native asset bridging with wrapped tokens
- **EVM Compatibility**: Execute Ethereum contracts via CosmWasm
- **Multi-Chain Router**: Optimal chain routing for transactions
- **Universal Addresses**: Chain-agnostic address system

### **Additional Modules**
- **Full IBC Protocol**: Complete IBC relayer network implementation
- **Staking Module**: Proof-of-stake for relayer network
- **Governance Module**: On-chain proposals and parameter updates

### **Developer Experience**
