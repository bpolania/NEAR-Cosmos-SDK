# Cosmos-on-NEAR

A Cosmos-inspired application-layer runtime implemented as NEAR smart contracts using Rust and the official NEAR SDK.

## Overview

This project recreates essential Cosmos modules without ABCI or Tendermint, including:

- **Bank Module**: Fungible token balances with transfer and mint operations
- **Staking Module**: Delegated tokens, validators, and unbonding periods
- **Governance Module**: Parameter store and voting mechanism

All persistent state lives in NEAR's key-value store, namespaced by byte-prefixed keys that mirror Cosmos multistore paths.

## Architecture

```
cosmos_on_near_rust/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs             # Main contract entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bank.rs            # Token transfer and minting
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ staking.rs         # Validator management and delegation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ governance.rs      # Parameter proposals and voting
â”œâ”€â”€ target/near/           # Compiled WASM artifacts
â””â”€â”€ Cargo.toml            # Rust dependencies
```

## Requirements

- Rust 1.86.0 (for NEAR-compatible WASM compilation)
- cargo-near (for proper NEAR contract building)
- near-cli (for deployment)

## Building

```bash
# Set Rust version to 1.86.0 for NEAR compatibility
rustup override set 1.86.0

# Build with cargo-near for proper NEAR contract
cargo near build

# Output will be in target/near/cosmos_on_near_rust.wasm
```

## Deployment

```bash
# Build the contract
cd cosmos_on_near_rust
cargo near build

# Deploy to NEAR testnet
near deploy --accountId your-account.testnet --wasmFile target/near/cosmos_on_near_rust.wasm

# Initialize contract
near call your-account.testnet new '{}' --accountId your-account.testnet
```

**Note**: This project uses the official NEAR SDK for Rust with cargo-near for reliable WASM compilation and deployment.

## Module Details

### Bank Module
- `Balance` struct with efficient binary serialization
- `Transfer(sender, receiver, amount)` - Transfer tokens between accounts
- `Mint(receiver, amount)` - Create new tokens
- All operations emit NEAR logs via custom runtime bindings

### Staking Module
- Validator registration and delegation tracking
- 100-block unbonding period for undelegations
- 5% flat reward percentage distributed per block
- `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock` hooks for processing

### Governance Module
- Parameter store for on-chain configuration
- 50-block voting periods
- 50% quorum threshold for proposal passage
- Parameter changes applied automatically on successful votes

### Block Processing
- `ProcessBlock()` function increments block height counter
- Calls `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock` hooks for all modules
- Designed for cron.cat integration for regular execution

## Technical Implementation

### Testing Strategy
The contract has been thoroughly tested on NEAR testnet with all modules functioning correctly:

- âœ… Bank Module: Transfer and minting operations
- âœ… Staking Module: Validator registration, delegation, and rewards
- âœ… Governance Module: Proposal submission and voting
- âœ… Block Processing: Cross-module integration and state management

For integration testing, consider using [near-workspaces](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs) - the Rust equivalent of Hardhat for NEAR contracts.

## NEAR Gas Considerations

- Storage operations consume gas proportional to data size
- Iterator operations can be expensive for large datasets
- Block processing should complete within gas limits
- Consider pagination for large collections

## Development Notes

The codebase is structured to mirror Cosmos SDK patterns while adapting to NEAR's execution model. Key differences:

1. **No ABCI**: Direct function calls instead of ABCI messages
2. **Single Contract**: All modules in one contract vs. separate modules
3. **NEAR Storage**: Key-value store instead of IAVL trees
4. **Block Simulation**: Manual block increment vs. Tendermint consensus


## Status

### âœ… **Production Ready**

The Rust implementation has been successfully deployed and tested:

- **âœ… NEAR SDK Integration**: Uses official NEAR SDK for Rust with cargo-near
- **âœ… All Modules Functional**: Bank, staking, and governance modules fully operational
- **âœ… Testnet Deployment**: Successfully deployed and tested on `demo.cuteharbor3573.testnet`
- **âœ… Cross-Module Integration**: Block processing and state management verified

### Ready for Production
The contract is ready for:
1. âœ… NEAR testnet deployment (completed)
2. âœ… Integration testing with real NEAR environment (completed)
3. ðŸ”„ Production deployment with cron.cat automation

The core architecture and business logic have been proven through comprehensive testing on live NEAR testnet, making this a robust Cosmos-inspired runtime for NEAR Protocol.
