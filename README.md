# Cosmos-on-NEAR

A Cosmos-inspired application-layer runtime implemented as NEAR smart contracts using Rust and the official NEAR SDK.

## Overview

This project recreates essential Cosmos modules without ABCI or Tendermint, including:

- **Bank Module**: Fungible token balances with transfer and mint operations
- **Staking Module**: Delegated tokens, validators, and unbonding periods
- **Governance Module**: Parameter store and voting mechanism
- **IBC Light Client**: Inter-Blockchain Communication via Tendermint light client (ICS-07)
- **IBC Connection Module**: Connection handshake protocol for cross-chain communication (ICS-03)
- **IBC Channel Module**: Packet-based messaging protocol for reliable cross-chain communication (ICS-04)

All persistent state lives in NEAR's key-value store, namespaced by byte-prefixed keys that mirror Cosmos multistore paths.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.86.0 (for NEAR-compatible WASM compilation)
- cargo-near (for proper NEAR contract building)
- near-cli (for deployment)

## Building

```bash
# Set Rust version to 1.86.0 for NEAR compatibility
rustup override set 1.86.0

# Build with cargo-near for proper NEAR contract
cargo near build

# Output will be in target/near/cosmos_sdk_near.wasm
```

## Deployment

```bash
# Build the contract
cd cosmos_sdk_near
cargo near build

# Deploy to NEAR testnet
near deploy --accountId your-account.testnet --wasmFile target/near/cosmos_sdk_near.wasm

# Initialize contract
near call your-account.testnet new '{}' --accountId your-account.testnet
```

**Note**: This project uses the official NEAR SDK for Rust with cargo-near for reliable WASM compilation and deployment.

```bash
cd cosmos_sdk_near
cargo test

#### Production Validation
The unified Cosmos SDK NEAR contract has been successfully tested on live NEAR testnet:
- **Unified Contract**: All modules (Bank, Staking, Gov, IBC) functioning correctly
- **Deployment Target**: Ready for deployment with new unified structure

## NEAR Gas Considerations

- Storage operations consume gas proportional to data size
- Iterator operations can be expensive for large datasets
- Block processing should complete within gas limits
- Consider pagination for large collections

## Development Notes

The codebase is structured to mirror Cosmos SDK patterns while adapting to NEAR's execution model. Key differences:

1. **No ABCI**: Direct function calls instead of ABCI messages
2. **Single Contract**: All modules in one contract vs. separate modules
3. **NEAR Storage**: Key-value store instead of IAVL trees
4. **Block Simulation**: Manual block increment vs. Tendermint consensus


## Status
