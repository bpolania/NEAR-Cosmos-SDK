# Technical Debt & Future Enhancements

This document tracks technical debt, deferred features, and future enhancements for the Proxima project.

## Deferred Features (Phase 2)

### Multi-signature Support (Week 3.1)
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Deferred  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks  

**Description:**
Implement comprehensive multi-signature transaction support for enhanced security and institutional use cases.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Multi-signature account creation and management
- [ ] Threshold-based signing logic (m-of-n signatures)
- [ ] Enhanced signature verification for multi-sig scenarios
- [ ] Support for different signature schemes in same transaction
- [ ] Multi-sig account recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Transaction coordination for multiple signers

**Technical Considerations:**
- Extend `CosmosAccount` structure to support multi-sig configuration
- Enhance `SignatureVerifier` to handle multiple signatures and thresholds
- Add multi-sig transaction building and coordination
- Consider gas implications of multiple signature verifications
- Ensure compatibility with Cosmos SDK multi-sig standards

**Impact:**
- **Security**: Enhanced security for high-value transactions
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Critical for institutional users
- **Cosmos Compatibility**: Full compatibility with Cosmos SDK multi-sig

### Hardware Wallet Integration (Week 3.2)
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Deferred  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks  

**Description:**
Add support for hardware wallet signing (Ledger, Trezor) for enhanced security and user experience.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Ledger device integration and communication
- [ ] Trezor device integration and communication
- [ ] Hardware wallet key derivation (BIP44/BIP32)
- [ ] USB/HID communication protocols
- [ ] Hardware wallet transaction signing flow
- [ ] Device detection and management
- [ ] Error handling for device disconnection/issues

**Technical Considerations:**
