# Technical Debt & Future Enhancements

This document tracks technical debt, deferred features, and future enhancements for the Proxima project.

## Deferred Features

### Phase 2 Deferred Features

### Multi-signature Support (Week 3.1)
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Deferred  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks  

**Description:**
Implement comprehensive multi-signature transaction support for enhanced security and institutional use cases.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Multi-signature account creation and management
- [ ] Threshold-based signing logic (m-of-n signatures)
- [ ] Enhanced signature verification for multi-sig scenarios
- [ ] Support for different signature schemes in same transaction
- [ ] Multi-sig account recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Transaction coordination for multiple signers

**Technical Considerations:**
- Extend `CosmosAccount` structure to support multi-sig configuration
- Enhance `SignatureVerifier` to handle multiple signatures and thresholds
- Add multi-sig transaction building and coordination
- Consider gas implications of multiple signature verifications
- Ensure compatibility with Cosmos SDK multi-sig standards

**Impact:**
- **Security**: Enhanced security for high-value transactions
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Critical for institutional users
- **Cosmos Compatibility**: Full compatibility with Cosmos SDK multi-sig

### Hardware Wallet Integration (Week 3.2)
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Deferred  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks  

**Description:**
Add support for hardware wallet signing (Ledger, Trezor) for enhanced security and user experience.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Ledger device integration and communication
- [ ] Trezor device integration and communication
- [ ] Hardware wallet key derivation (BIP44/BIP32)
- [ ] USB/HID communication protocols
- [ ] Hardware wallet transaction signing flow
- [ ] Device detection and management
- [ ] Error handling for device disconnection/issues

**Technical Considerations:**
- Add USB/HID communication libraries
- Implement Ledger APDU command protocol
- Implement Trezor Protocol Buffers communication
- Add hardware wallet-specific key derivation paths
- Consider browser compatibility (WebUSB/WebHID)
- Add secure transaction display and confirmation flows

**Dependencies:**
- External hardware wallet SDKs/libraries
- USB access permissions and drivers
- Browser security policies for WebUSB

**Impact:**
- **Security**: Cold storage security for transaction signing
- **User Experience**: Professional-grade wallet integration
- **Ecosystem**: Compatibility with existing Cosmos hardware wallet users

### Phase 3 Advanced Architecture (Future Development)
**Priority**: Low  
**Status**: Deferred  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks  

**Description:**
Implement advanced Cosmos SDK architectural patterns to achieve ~95% traditional Cosmos chain compatibility.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Module Manager pattern implementation
- [ ] Keeper pattern for inter-module communication
- [ ] Enhanced event emission system matching Cosmos SDK standards exactly
- [ ] Advanced BeginBlock/EndBlock hook patterns
- [ ] Module dependency injection and lifecycle management
- [ ] Enhanced ABCI compatibility for advanced tooling

**Technical Considerations:**
- Design module manager architecture for proper initialization and dependency resolution
- Implement Keeper interfaces for controlled state access across modules
- Enhance event emission to match Cosmos SDK indexing requirements exactly
- Add sophisticated block processing hooks for advanced module patterns
- Consider performance implications of additional abstraction layers
- Maintain backward compatibility with Phase 2 implementations

**Impact:**
- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Enhanced compatibility with advanced Cosmos SDK tooling
- **Developer Experience**: More familiar patterns for Cosmos SDK developers
- **Future-Proofing**: Better foundation for complex custom modules
- **Completeness**: Achieve near-complete Cosmos SDK architectural parity

**Current Assessment:**
Phase 3 is not immediately necessary as Phase 2 provides ~85% Cosmos SDK compatibility, sufficient for most use cases including wallets, CLI tools, IBC, and ecosystem tooling. Phase 3 would be valuable for advanced use cases requiring specific Cosmos SDK architectural patterns.

## Minor Technical Debt

- [ ] **Ambiguous Glob Exports**: Resolve module namespace conflicts in auth and types modules
- [ ] **Unused Variables**: Fix unused variable warnings in test functions
- [ ] **Mutable Variables**: Remove unnecessary `mut` declarations in tests

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Gas Estimation**: Improve gas estimation accuracy based on actual execution costs
- [ ] **Batch Operations**: Optimize batch signature verification for multi-message transactions
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Profile and optimize memory usage in large transaction processing
- [ ] **Storage Efficiency**: Review and optimize NEAR storage patterns for cost reduction

### Documentation
