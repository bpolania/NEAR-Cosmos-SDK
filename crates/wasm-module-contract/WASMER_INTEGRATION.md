# Wasmer Integration Status

## Overview
The Wasmer integration for executing WebAssembly bytecode in the CosmWasm compatibility layer is now foundational infrastructure in place, with comprehensive tests passing.

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
1. **Wasmer Dependencies Added** - Wasmer 3.1 integrated with conditional compilation
2. **WasmRuntime Module** - Dual-mode execution system with Wasmer and pattern-matching fallback
3. **WasmerExecutor Module** - Infrastructure for WASM compilation and execution
4. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - 18 tests covering all aspects of the integration
5. **Pattern Matching Fallback** - Full support for CW20, CW721, and CW1 contract types
6. **Error Handling** - Robust error handling for invalid WASM modules

### ðŸš§ In Progress
1. **Real WASM Execution** - Needs actual CosmWasm bytecode to test full execution
2. **Host Functions** - Simplified placeholders ready for full implementation
3. **Memory Management** - CosmWasm region-based memory access prepared

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
1. **Complete Host Functions** - Implement full CosmWasm host function bridge
2. **Gas Metering** - Add gas consumption tracking for WASM execution
3. **Real CosmWasm Testing** - Test with actual compiled CosmWasm contracts
4. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize memory access and function calls

### Key Components

#### WasmRuntime (`src/wasm_runtime.rs`)
- Main orchestrator for WASM execution
- Manages dual-mode execution (Wasmer + fallback)
- Handles contract state and storage
- Pattern detection for known contract types

#### WasmerExecutor (`src/wasmer_executor.rs`)
- Wasmer-specific execution logic
- WASM module compilation and instantiation
- Host function imports
- Memory management for CosmWasm regions

#### Pattern Matching Fallback
- CW20 Token: Transfer, Mint, Burn, Allowances
- CW721 NFT: Minting, Metadata
- CW1 Multisig: Admin management
- Generic contract support

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Runtime creation and configuration
- WASM validation
- Fallback mechanisms
- Contract type detection
- CW20 operations (transfer, mint, burn, allowances)
- CW721 NFT operations
- Query operations
- Error handling

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all Wasmer integration tests
cargo test --test wasmer_integration_tests

# Run specific test
cargo test --test wasmer_integration_tests test_wasmer_runtime_creation
```

## Current Limitations

1. **Test WASM Only** - Current implementation rejects minimal test WASM modules
2. **Simplified Host Functions** - Host functions return placeholder values
3. **No Gas Metering** - Gas consumption not tracked yet
4. **Limited Memory Bridge** - Full CosmWasm memory management not implemented

## Next Steps

1. **Obtain Real CosmWasm Bytecode**
   - Compile actual CosmWasm contracts
   - Test with real WASM modules
   
2. **Implement Full Host Functions**
   - Complete storage operations (db_read, db_write, db_remove)
   - Address validation and canonicalization
   - Cryptographic functions
   - Query operations

3. **Add Gas Metering**
   - Track WASM instruction costs
   - Integrate with NEAR gas model
   - Implement gas limits

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache compiled modules
   - Optimize memory access patterns
   - Benchmark against native execution

## Technical Notes

### Wasmer Version
Using Wasmer 3.1 due to API stability and compatibility with the NEAR environment.

### Conditional Compilation
Wasmer is only included in non-WASM builds using:
```rust
#[cfg(not(target_family = "wasm"))]
```

### Memory Model
CosmWasm uses a region-based memory model with (offset, capacity, length) structs for passing data between host and guest.

### Error Recovery
The implementation includes panic catching for Wasmer operations that might cause aborts with invalid WASM.
