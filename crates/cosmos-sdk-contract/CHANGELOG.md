# Changelog

All notable changes to the Cosmos SDK Contract will be documented in this file.

## [0.9.0] - 2025-08-06

### Added

#### Modular CosmWasm Architecture Implementation
- **Complete x/wasm Module**: Full Cosmos SDK compatible module for arbitrary contract deployment
  - CodeID system for unique WASM bytecode identification
  - Deterministic contract address generation
  - Configurable instantiation permissions (Everybody, Nobody, OnlyAddress, AnyOfAddresses)
  - Independent state management for each contract instance
  - Complete store_code → instantiate → execute → query lifecycle

#### Separate wasm-module-contract
- **Standalone Deployment**: Independent contract for x/wasm module functionality
- **Cross-Contract Communication**: Router-mediated calls between main contract and wasm module
- **Storage Isolation**: Each deployed CosmWasm contract maintains independent state
- **Access Control System**: Comprehensive permission management for code instantiation

#### Advanced Module Architecture
- **Router Contract**: Central message routing and coordination system
- **Module Registration**: Dynamic module discovery and management
- **Cross-Module Communication**: Standardized inter-module call patterns
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and module status reporting

### Enhanced

#### CosmWasm Operations
- **store_code()**: Store WASM bytecode with metadata and permission configuration
- **instantiate()**: Deploy contract instances with proper addressing and state setup
- **execute()**: Execute messages on deployed contracts with full state management
- **query()**: Read-only contract state access with result serialization
- **get_code_info()**: Retrieve code metadata including creator, hash, and permissions
- **list_codes()**: Paginated listing of all stored WASM codes
- **list_contracts_by_code()**: Query contract instances by CodeID

#### Cross-Contract Communication Infrastructure
- **Message Router**: Centralized routing for inter-module calls
- **State Synchronization**: Consistent state management across module boundaries
- **Event Aggregation**: Module events collected and emitted through router
- **Permission Delegation**: Fine-grained access control for cross-module operations

### Testing & Quality Assurance

#### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **41 Integration Tests**: Complete wasm module functionality coverage (100% passing)
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Bulk operations testing (25 codes, 100 contracts)
- **Security Validation**: Access control and permission enforcement testing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenario coverage and recovery testing

#### Test Categories Added
- **Unit Tests (30 tests)**: Core module functionality with complete coverage
- **Integration Tests (7 tests)**: Real deployment scenarios with NEAR Workspaces
- **Performance Tests (4 tests)**: Load testing and concurrent access validation
- **Compatibility Tests**: CosmWasm contract migration and execution validation

### Deployment & Operations

#### Automated Deployment Scripts
- **deploy-modular.sh**: Complete modular architecture deployment
- **build-wasm-module.sh**: Standalone wasm module building
- **migrate-to-modular.sh**: Migration from monolithic to modular architecture
- **verify-modular-architecture.sh**: Post-deployment validation and testing

#### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Flexible network and account configuration
- **Module Registration**: Automated module discovery and registration
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive module health checking and status reporting

### Removed

#### Legacy Integration Tests
- **Monolithic Test Files**: Removed tests designed for old single-contract interface
  - `bank_integration_tests.rs` - Superseded by modular banking module
  - `block_integration_tests.rs` - Block processing moved to router pattern
  - `ibc_client_integration_tests.rs` - IBC operations redesigned for modular architecture
  - `ibc_connection_integration_tests.rs` - Connection handling updated for modularity
  - `ibc_multistore_integration_tests.rs` - Multi-store verification redesigned
  - `cw20_local_deployment_test.rs` - Deployment patterns updated for modular system
  - `cosmwasm_performance_benchmarks.rs` - Performance testing approach changed

### Technical Improvements

#### Code Organization
- **Module Separation**: Clear boundaries between router and individual modules
- **Type System**: Comprehensive Cosmos SDK compatible type definitions
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error types and response patterns
- **Storage Optimization**: Efficient NEAR collections usage and key management

#### Build System
- **Feature Flags**: Conditional compilation for different deployment modes  
- **Cargo Workspace**: Organized multi-crate structure for modular components
- **WASM Optimization**: Size and performance optimizations for contract deployment

### Documentation

#### Architecture Documentation
- **README.md**: Complete guide to modular CosmWasm architecture
- **Deployment Guides**: Step-by-step deployment and configuration instructions
- **API Reference**: Complete method documentation with examples
- **Migration Guide**: Instructions for upgrading from monolithic architecture

### Migration Notes

#### Breaking Changes
- **Module Interface**: New modular interface replaces monolithic contract methods
- **Deployment Process**: Requires deployment of multiple contracts instead of single contract
- **Configuration**: New environment variables and configuration parameters

#### Upgrade Path
1. Deploy router contract using `deploy-modular.sh`
2. Deploy individual module contracts
3. Register modules with router
4. Migrate existing data if needed
5. Update client applications to use router interface

### Performance

#### Optimizations
- **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized storage patterns and execution paths
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient state management and caching strategies
- **Network Calls**: Minimized cross-contract calls through intelligent routing

#### Benchmarks
- **Code Storage**: <10s per operation for codes up to 3MB
- **Contract Instantiation**: <15s per operation with proper state initialization
- **Query Performance**: <5s response time for complex queries
- **Concurrent Access**: Validated with 5+ concurrent users

This release represents a significant architectural evolution, enabling modular deployment and management of CosmWasm contracts on NEAR Protocol while maintaining full Cosmos SDK compatibility.
