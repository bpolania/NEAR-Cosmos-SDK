4. **TinyGo Compatibility**: Careful selection of supported Go features

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual module functions
- Mock store for isolated module testing
- Integration tests for cross-module interactions
- Examples of NEAR CLI testing commands

### Production Readiness
The implementation follows Cosmos SDK patterns while adapting to:
- NEAR's execution model (no ABCI)
- TinyGo's WASM limitations
- Key-value storage instead of IAVL trees
- Direct function calls vs. message passing

### Deployment Information
- Contract size: ~420KB (optimized)
- Target runtime: NEAR Protocol
- Build tool: TinyGo 0.32.0
- WASM format: wasm32-unknown-unknown

### Example Operations
```bash
# Transfer tokens
near call $CONTRACT transfer '{"receiver":"alice.near","amount":"1000"}' --accountId bob.near

# Create proposal
near call $CONTRACT submit_proposal '{"changes":[["min_stake","5000"]]}' --accountId alice.near

# Process blocks
near call $CONTRACT process_block '{}' --accountId cron.near
```

This foundational work provides a solid base for implementing more complex Cosmos SDK features on NEAR Protocol.

## Session 24 - NEAR State Proof Generation Implementation (2025-07-27)

### Overview
Completed the critical NEAR state proof generation system, enabling real cryptographic verification of NEAR blockchain state for IBC packet commitments, acknowledgments, and timeouts. This replaces mock implementations with production-ready NEAR RPC integration.

### Implementation Details

1. **Real NEAR RPC Integration**
   - **Dependency Resolution**: Fixed NEAR crate version conflicts by aligning all dependencies to v0.30.3 (matching `near-jsonrpc-client` v0.17.0)
   - **Real Contract Calls**: `call_contract_view()` now makes actual NEAR RPC calls to deployed contract
   - **State Proof Queries**: `get_state_proof()` retrieves real NEAR merkle proofs with proper error handling
   - **Block Height Queries**: `get_latest_height()` returns actual NEAR blockchain height
   - **Health Monitoring**: `health_check()` performs real NEAR RPC status verification

2. **NEAR State Proof Generator** (`src/relay/near_proof.rs`)
   ```rust
   pub struct NearProofGenerator {
       chain_id: String,
       contract_id: AccountId,
       rpc_client: JsonRpcClient,
   }
   ```

3. **Production Proof Generation**
   - **Packet Commitment Proofs**: `generate_packet_commitment_proof()` creates real NEAR state proofs
   - **Acknowledgment Proofs**: `generate_acknowledgment_proof()` for packet acknowledgment verification
   - **Timeout Proofs**: `generate_timeout_proof()` proves packet non-existence for timeouts
   - **IBC-Compatible Formatting**: `format_as_ibc_proof()` converts NEAR proofs to IBC specification format

4. **Technical Achievements**
   ```rust
   // Real NEAR state proof structure
   pub struct NearStateProof {
       pub block_height: BlockHeight,
       pub block_hash: CryptoHash,
       pub account_id: AccountId,
       pub storage_key: String,
       pub storage_proof: Vec<u8>,        // Real merkle proof data
       pub values: Vec<StateItem>,        // Actual state values
   }
   ```

5. **Cryptographic Security**
   - **SHA256 Integrity Verification**: All proofs include cryptographic integrity hashes
   - **NEAR Merkle Integration**: Direct integration with NEAR's merkle proof system
   - **Tamper-Proof Verification**: Real blockchain state proofs prevent forgery
   - **IBC Specification Compliance**: Proofs formatted for IBC light client verification

### Dependency Management Resolution

1. **Version Conflicts Fixed**
   - **Root Cause**: Multiple versions of NEAR crates (0.23.0 vs 0.30.3) causing type mismatches
   - **Solution**: Updated all NEAR dependencies to exactly match `near-jsonrpc-client` v0.17.0 requirements:
     ```toml
     near-jsonrpc-client = "0.17.0"
     near-jsonrpc-primitives = "0.30.3"
     near-primitives = "0.30.3"
     near-crypto = "0.30.3"
     ```

2. **Type Compatibility**
   - Fixed `BlockReference` import conflicts
   - Resolved `QueryResponseKind` version mismatches
   - Corrected `CryptoHash` type alignment
   - Handled `Vec<Arc<[u8]>>` proof data properly

3. **Production Implementation**
   - Replaced all mock responses with real NEAR RPC calls
   - Implemented proper error handling for network failures
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing APIs
