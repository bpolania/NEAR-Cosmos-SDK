# Changelog

This file tracks the development progress of the NEAR-Cosmos-SDK project.

## Repository Structure Changes (2025-07-30)

**Changelog Organization Update:**
- 📁 Created `CHANGELOG-HISTORICAL/` folder for historical development sessions
- 📄 Moved `CHANGELOG-00.md` → `CHANGELOG-HISTORICAL/CHANGELOG-00.md`
- 📄 Renamed `CHANGELOG-01.md` → `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
- 🔗 Updated cross-references to reflect new structure

This reorganization provides clearer separation between current development and historical archive, making it easier to navigate the project's evolution.

## Version Number Adjustment (2025-07-30)

**Beta Status Clarification:**
- 📊 Changed version from `1.0.0` → `0.9.0-beta` across all components
- 🔄 Updated README, Cargo.toml files, and documentation
- 🧪 **Rationale**: While the system is production-ready technically, it hasn't undergone external beta testing by users
- ✅ **Status**: All functionality remains the same - this is purely a version number adjustment to reflect beta status

**Updated Components:**
- Smart Contract: `cosmos-sdk-contract v0.9.0`
- IBC Relayer: `ibc-relayer v0.9.0`
- Workspace: `v0.9.0`

This change better reflects the current maturity status - production-ready code that needs broader community testing before a stable 1.0 release.
