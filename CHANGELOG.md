4. **TinyGo Compatibility**: Careful selection of supported Go features

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual module functions
- Mock store for isolated module testing
- Integration tests for cross-module interactions
- Examples of NEAR CLI testing commands

### Production Readiness
The implementation follows Cosmos SDK patterns while adapting to:
- NEAR's execution model (no ABCI)
- TinyGo's WASM limitations
- Key-value storage instead of IAVL trees
- Direct function calls vs. message passing

### Deployment Information
- Contract size: ~420KB (optimized)
- Target runtime: NEAR Protocol
- Build tool: TinyGo 0.32.0
- WASM format: wasm32-unknown-unknown

### Example Operations
```bash
# Transfer tokens
near call $CONTRACT transfer '{"receiver":"alice.near","amount":"1000"}' --accountId bob.near

# Create proposal
near call $CONTRACT submit_proposal '{"changes":[["min_stake","5000"]]}' --accountId alice.near

# Process blocks
near call $CONTRACT process_block '{}' --accountId cron.near
```

This foundational work provides a solid base for implementing more complex Cosmos SDK features on NEAR Protocol.

## Session 28 - KeyStore Integration Module Resolution Fix (2025-07-29)

### Overview
Resolved critical module resolution issues that prevented cargo tests from running, ensuring the keystore integration is fully functional and tested across all compilation contexts.

- **Impact**: Binary compilation could not resolve `crate::keystore` imports
- **Symptoms**: `cargo test` failing with "unresolved import `crate::keystore`" errors
- **Library vs Binary**: Library compilation worked fine, but binary and tests failed

### Technical Resolution

#### 1. **Module Declaration Fix**
**Fixed main.rs module declarations**:
```rust
// Added missing keystore module declaration
mod config;
mod chains;
mod keystore;  // ← This was missing!
mod relay;
mod metrics;
```

#### 2. **Test Re-enablement**
**Restored `test_cosmos_keystore_integration`**:
- Removed `#[ignore]` attribute that was temporarily added during troubleshooting
- Implemented comprehensive test that validates:
  - KeyManager creation and key storage with encryption
  - CosmosChain keystore integration via `configure_account_with_keystore()`
  - Proper failure at expected network call step (not keystore operations)
  - Full end-to-end keystore workflow validation

#### 3. **Integration Method Restoration**
**Complete `configure_account_with_keystore()` method**:
```rust
pub async fn configure_account_with_keystore(
    &mut self, 
    chain_id: &str,
    key_manager: &mut KeyManager,
) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
    // Load key from encrypted keystore
    let key_entry = key_manager.load_key(chain_id).await?;
    
    // Validate and configure account with keystore key
    match key_entry {
        KeyEntry::Cosmos(cosmos_key) => {
            cosmos_key.validate()?;
            self.configure_account_with_key(
                cosmos_key.address.clone(), 
                cosmos_key.private_key_hex()
            ).await?;

### Test Results

**Complete test suite now passes**:
- **168 tests total**: 168 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored ✅
- **Full keystore integration**: Tested and verified ✅
- **All compilation contexts**: Library, binary, examples, and tests ✅

### Verification

**Validated functionality across all contexts**:
1. **Library compilation**: `cargo check --lib` ✅
2. **Binary compilation**: `cargo check` ✅  
3. **Example compilation**: `cargo check --example cosmos_keystore_integration` ✅
4. **Test execution**: `cargo test` ✅
5. **Specific test**: `cargo test test_cosmos_keystore_integration` ✅

### Impact

This fix ensures that:
- **KeyStore integration is fundamental**: Now properly integrated as a core system component
- **Production readiness**: Full compilation and testing coverage across all contexts
- **Developer experience**: No more compilation errors when running tests
- **CI/CD reliability**: Test suite can run completely without module resolution issues

### Summary

The module resolution fix transforms the keystore from a partially working feature to a fully integrated, production-ready component. With all 168 tests passing and complete compilation coverage, the keystore integration now provides the secure foundation needed for testnet and mainnet deployments of the IBC relayer.
